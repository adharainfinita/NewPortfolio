	aboutMeP1:`I started my career as a programmer taking courses like Henry and Transistemas, which gave me a challenging 
	and powerful journey. In addition to being a web developer, I stand out for studying Information Systems at the university, 
	where I delve deeper and seek to achieve mastery of software engineering. In my free time I write literature and philosophy. 
	My dedication to writing novels began at a young age, and before entering the world of technology, I studied philosophy as a teacher.`,
